# Release Qualification

This document defines the evidence required before a Mangarr release candidate
can become a stable release. Passing unit tests alone is not sufficient.

## Release Under Test

- Release candidate: `1.3.0-rc.1`
- Stable target: `1.3.0`
- Qualified base / previous stable: `1.2.0`
- Candidate image: `ghcr.io/kha-kis/manga-arr:1.3.0-rc.1`
- Candidate digest: pending publication
- Platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`

The current stable release remains 1.2.0. This preparation branch does not tag,
publish, deploy, or move any stable image alias. Stable 1.3.0 remains blocked
until the exact reviewed candidate commit satisfies every applicable gate below.

## Release Preparation Evidence

The release-preparation branch must record fresh evidence from its exact tree:

- focused release metadata and documentation consistency tests;
- `make test-release-safe` with Python, confirmation-flow, route-sweep, and all
  isolated browser suite counts;
- `make release-local`, including dependency, secret, configuration, image
  identity/content, and fixed High/Critical vulnerability gates;
- generated image tags containing only
  `ghcr.io/kha-kis/manga-arr:1.3.0-rc.1`.

Results are recorded in the candidate changelog and pull request after the
commands complete. A passing preparation branch does not qualify an unpublished
image or authorize stable promotion.

## 1.3 Metadata Acceptance

The 1.3 milestone establishes these operator-facing invariants:

- stored AniList and MangaUpdates identities anchor future enrichment;
- one unique stored-MAL match can anchor AniList resolution, while ambiguous
  title-only results fail closed and preserve cached metadata;
- every production creation and adoption path initializes deterministic title
  provenance and locking in the series-creation transaction;
- unlocking a local title relinquishes its recommendation dominance without
  mutating the title, and explicit candidate application transfers ownership;
- equal-value source drift can reconcile provenance without rewriting the
  application value or triggering value-change side effects;
- metadata application revalidates current values, candidates, conflicts, and
  locks before committing;
- existing-library matching reports equal-strength identity ambiguity while
  preserving explicit operator selection;
- AniList candidate confidence records the actual current identity evidence;
- downloaded and local count observations remain lower bounds, and ambiguous or
  failed provider resolution cannot remove cached metadata or local files.

`tests/python/test_metadata_milestone_lifecycle.py` is the final integrated
acceptance gate added by PR #369. Its three scenarios exercise production
creation/adoption routes, provenance and lock transitions, search and grab,
completed-download import, durable filesystem publication, rescan, and later
metadata refresh while replacing only external provider, indexer, cover, and
download-client I/O.

Publication year or format as automatic identity tie-break evidence, exact
provenance for bare numeric metadata searches, and historical/original
discovery-confidence storage remain intentionally deferred. The fail-closed
identity policy makes these non-blocking for 1.3.

## Candidate Qualification Gates

### Exact Commit And Publication

1. Merge the reviewed release-preparation PR without changing its qualified
   content.
2. Run `make release-local` from the exact merge commit.
3. Create immutable tag `v1.3.0-rc.1` on that exact commit only after the local
   gate passes.
4. Confirm the release workflow publishes both amd64 and arm64 manifests and
   record the resulting candidate digest.
5. Verify the image reports version `1.3.0-rc.1`, the tagged commit revision,
   the expected non-root user, and the allowlisted runtime files.
6. Confirm publication creates only `1.3.0-rc.1`; `1.3`, `1`, and `latest`
   must not move. Existing stable tags `1.2.0` and `1.2` must remain unchanged.

### Fresh Installation

1. Pull the candidate by exact version or digest from the public registry.
2. Start it as a non-root user against empty `/config` and library directories
   using the public Compose configuration.
3. Complete browser-first administrator creation, login, logout, and offline
   administrator recovery.
4. Verify `/healthz`, System Status version/revision, database integrity,
   foreign keys, and writable configured paths.
5. Add a representative series and complete metadata refresh,
   existing-library adoption, and search/grab/import workflows.

### Upgrade And Rollback

1. Stop stable 1.2.0 and create a matching copy or snapshot of realistic
   `/config` data, including the database and secret key.
2. Start the candidate against a copy of that snapshot and verify migrations,
   administrator login, stored credential decryption, library counts, provider
   identities, title ownership, downloaded state, and folder mappings.
3. Refresh representative existing libraries, including manual, local, and
   provider-owned titles, and verify no unexpected identity or ownership
   changes.
4. Exercise existing-library adoption and one representative
   search/grab/download/import/rescan lifecycle.
5. Stop the candidate, restore the matching stopped 1.2.0 `/config` snapshot,
   and verify rollback with the stable image. Never run 1.2.0 against a database
   already migrated by the candidate.

### Integrity And Operational Evidence

Record all of the following from the qualification environment:

- `PRAGMA integrity_check` returns `ok` and `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` returns
  no rows before and after the representative workflows;
- `/healthz` remains HTTP 200, with no unexpected HTTP 5xx responses,
  application errors, tracebacks, container restarts, or database-lock errors;
- metadata refresh preserves cached values during provider failures and makes
  no unexpected provider-ID, title-ownership, downloaded-count, or local-file
  changes;
- search/grab/import completes with exact download-client ownership and one
  durable imported result;
- each configured download client completes an authenticated operation that
  requires its stored credential; a public version endpoint alone is not
  sufficient evidence;
- existing-library adoption preserves the explicitly selected identity and
  folder mapping;
- no recurring configuration errors or circuit-breaker transitions occur for
  any download client;
- at least one full configured background polling/refresh cycle completes after
  the interactive checks, so scheduled behavior is observed rather than
  inferred from startup alone.

Qualification is evidence-driven. A fixed multi-week soak is not required by
policy, but any blocker or unexplained operational signal resets the affected
gate and requires a corrected candidate.

## Historical 1.2 Evidence

The 1.2.0 release was promoted from `1.2.0-rc.10` after more than 15 days of
production qualification. Its evidence included HTTP 200 health, zero
container restarts, database-lock failures, tracebacks, HTTP 5xx responses, or
application errors, schema version 5, `PRAGMA integrity_check` = `ok`, no
active recovery records, and a controlled qBittorrent-to-library import.

Earlier 1.2 candidates exposed and corrected health-probe starvation, SABnzbd
authentication and shared-path configuration, title-boundary matching,
publication-year volume parsing, terminal duplicate receipts, duplicate
Prowlarr polling, current Torznab parsing, protocol routing, and ambiguous
qBittorrent handoff recovery. That history remains useful regression context,
but neither the RC10 digest nor its production soak qualifies 1.3.0-rc.1.

## Stable Release Decision

Stable 1.3.0 is not yet approved. Promotion requires the published
`1.3.0-rc.1` image to satisfy the fresh-install, 1.2.0 upgrade and rollback,
metadata lifecycle, import, integrity, and operational gates above. The
candidate digest and results must be recorded before a stable release PR is
prepared.
